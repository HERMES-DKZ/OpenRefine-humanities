# OpenRefine for the Humanities
[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a powerful free, open-source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format to another; and extending it with web services and external data. This lesson is being developed specifically for researchers in the humanities and cultural studies, with the goal of becoming part of a future humanities curriculum within the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) lesson program. It is designed for learners with no prior experience. This lesson is visible at: https://hermes-dkz.github.io/OpenRefine-humanities/.


## Contributing
At this very early stage of lesson development, external contributions are not yet being processed. However, errors can be reported via [issues](https://github.com/HERMES-DKZ/OpenRefine-humanities/issues). Once the first release is published, contributions will be warmly welcomed, and the contributing workflow will be shared here.
