:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can we go back to an earlier step if we realize we made a mistake?  
- How can we save our cleaning process to repeat it later or share it with colleagues?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Use the Undo/Redo tab in OpenRefine to reverse mistakes.  
- Export and Import workflows.  
- Understand the value of transparency and reproducibility in data cleaning.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



When cleaning messy data, we rarely get everything right on the first try. In the earlier chapters of this lesson, we:

- Removed extra details from the **ArtistBio** column.  
- Split the column into separate parts, such as nationality.  
- Applied clustering to standardize values.  
- Reconciled artist names against an external authority.  

All of these steps helped us improve our dataset. But what if, after clustering, we realize that some merges were wrong? Or what if we decide later that splitting the ArtistBio column at commas wasn’t the best idea? Instead of starting all over again, OpenRefine allows us to **step backwards** and explore different alternatives.


## Undo/Redo

On the left-hand side of the OpenRefine interface, you will find the `Undo/Redo` tab. This tab lists every action you have taken since the project was created. Each action has a short label, such as *“Text transform on 2000 cells...* or *“Split multu-valued cells in column nationality”*.

1. Click on the `Undo/Redo` tab in the left sidebar.  
2. You will see a list of all your steps in order. The most recent one is at the bottom.  
3. By selecting an earlier step in the list, you can roll the dataset back to exactly how it looked at that moment.  

This is like having a *time machine* for your dataset: you can test transformations freely without the fear of making permanent mistakes. And if you change your mind, you can always jump back to any earlier state.

**Example:** After splitting the ArtistBio column into multiple parts, you might notice that the country information was separated cleanly, but the century data became fragmented and less useful. Using Undo/Redo, you can jump back to the step *before* the split and try a different approach.


## Exporting and Importing Workflows

Undo/Redo does more than let you move backwards. It also keeps track of your entire cleaning process as a set of instructions. OpenRefine can export these instructions as a **JSON file**. This file is not the cleaned data itself, but the *recipe* of how the cleaning was done with the used data. 

1. Go to the `Undo/Redo` tab.  
2. Click on the button `Extract...`.  
3. A dialog will open showing all the processing steps in JSON on the right side. You can select which steps to include into the JSON by selecting the checkboxes on the left side.  
4. Save the processing steps to a JSON file by clicking `Export` or copy it manually to your clippord and into a file on your computer. 

Later, you or someone else can **import** this workflow into another OpenRefine project:

1. In the `Undo/Redo` tab of the other project, click `Apply...`.  
2. Paste the JSON recipe or upload the file.  
3. OpenRefine will replay the exact same steps on the new dataset.  

This feature is especially powerful research, where transparency and reproducibility are essential. Instead of describing vaguely what was done, we can share the precise workflow that produced our dataset. Other researchers can review it, replicate it, or adapt it to their own data.

### Workflows as Reusable Recipes

Think of Undo/Redo export files as **recipes**. Just like a recipe tells you how to combine ingredients to bake a cake, an OpenRefine workflow tells you how to transform raw data into a cleaned dataset. If you don’t like the taste, you can always tweak the recipe.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Exporting data

The cleaned dataset can be exported in different formats tsv, csv, html ... You find that options under `Export` on the right top of your workbench. Here you also have the option to export the whole OpenRefine project (data and processing steps) for sharing with colleagues or other use cases. In this case you select `OpenRefine project to archive file` and an tar.zip file will be downloaded.

### Exporting pitfall

Ensure that no filters are active so that the entire dataset is exported. You can check this by looking at the information above the table, for example, “10 matching rows (1999 in total)”. In this case, only the subset of 10 data rows will be exported.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- OpenRefine records every transformation you make.  
- The **Undo/Redo** tab lets you move backward and forward through your cleaning process.  
- Workflows can be exported as JSON and reapplied to other projects, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
