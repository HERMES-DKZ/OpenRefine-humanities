OpenRefine is a powerful free, open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data. This lesson was especially developed for researchers in the humanities who want to learn how to improve the quality of their research data. It is designed for participants with no pevious experience.

OpenRefine is a powerful, free, open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it, transforming it from one format into another, and extending it with web services and external data.

In scientific research, data is rarely perfect. Information is often collected from many different sources, such as archives, museums, or fieldwork, and combined into a single dataset. This can lead to a variety of problems: names spelled in different ways, missing or inconsistent values, dates in different formats, or duplicate entries. Sometimes data is entered manually, which can introduce typos or errors. Other times, data comes from automated exports or digitization projects, which may not follow a consistent structure. As a result, researchers often face the challenge of working with data that is not ready for analysis.

Before you can draw meaningful conclusions from your data, it is essential to clean and organize it. This process helps ensure that your analysis is accurate and reliable. OpenRefine is designed to make this step easier, even for those with no technical background. With OpenRefine, you can quickly identify and fix errors, standardize formats, and prepare your data for further research.

This lesson was especially developed for researchers in the humanities who want to learn how to improve the quality of their research data. It is designed for participants with no previous experience.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- start a new OpenRefine project and import data
- work with a subset of your data with the help of facets and filters
- correct errors and reduce variations in your data through facets and clustering
- transform your data for future analysis
- use undo and redo actions of your cleaning steps
- enrich your data with the help of reconciliation service
- save and export cleaned data as well as data cleaning steps
