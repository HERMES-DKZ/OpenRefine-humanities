## Glossary

**Cell**  
A single data field within a row and column of a dataset.

**Clustering**  
A method that groups together values that are similar in spelling or sound, helping identify and standardize inconsistent entries.

**Column**  
A vertical set of related data values. Each column represents one variable or type of information.

**Custom Facet**  
A user-defined facet based on a GREL expression that evaluates each cell and groups results (e.g., “true/false”, categories, or computed values).

**Facet**  
An interactive filter that groups unique values in a column and shows their frequency (e.g., text facet, numeric facet).

**Filter**  
A search-based restriction of rows. Unlike facets, filters do not summarize or group values—they only hide non-matching rows.

**GREL (General Refine Expression Language)**  
A lightweight expression language used in OpenRefine to transform, clean, or evaluate cell values.

**Keying Function**  
The algorithm used in clustering to transform strings into simplified “keys” so that similar values can be grouped together.

**Literal Replacement**  
A GREL transformation that replaces a specific character or substring with another, often used to remove formatting characters.

**Record**  
A group of one or more rows that belongs together. Used when splitting multi-valued cells so related data stays linked.

**Row**  
A horizontal entry in the dataset, typically representing one item or observation.

**Split Multi-Valued Cells**  
An operation that separates multiple values stored in a single cell (based on a separator) into multiple rows within the same record.

**Text Facet**  
A facet that groups all unique text values in a column and displays their counts.

**Timeline Facet**  
A facet used on date-type columns to visualize and filter records over time with a histogram.

**Transformation**  
Any operation that changes the content of cells—e.g., formatting, replacements, or converting data types.

**Undo/Redo**  
The panel showing all steps performed during a project, allowing users to undo actions or export a workflow.
